# LESSONS LEARNED

- Double check the specification
- Double check filters in order to make sure I'm not operating on filtered data I (incorrectly) assume is unfiltered.
- The data formatting in Excel (or anywhere) makes a HUGE impact. Accounting format vs. number w/ 2 decimal means we get accurate dollar/cent rounding.
